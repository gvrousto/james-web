    description:
      '"Archimedes" began with Points of Sail and Gear Symbol discussing how we could create a physical oxymoron; an object that in it\'s essence is a contradiction. We settled on the idea of a Concrete Boat after discovering the beached WW1 Era concrete transport ships in Virginia Beach. They showed us that if we make the ship bouyant enough, it will float. Through scale models, and testing, we developed a shape that could both support the weight of a person and be cast in concrete.',

    description:
      "Baseball gloves have been a fascinating case study to hep define what makes something “handmade.” Each one has such an immense amount of personality. Every glove starts out as a cowhide, which is tanned and cut to the pattern shape of the design. Then, it is stamped with its branding and text, usually including the name and signature of the professional player who endorsed it. Still to this day, with all of the different ways we have mechanized our supply chains, baseball gloves are still laced together by hand at the factory.And that’s just its life before it hits the shelves.After purchase, we sign our names, phone numbers, and addresses and start the break-in process. I broke my first glove in by rubbing it down with mink oil, placing a baseball in the pocket, tightly tying it together, and leaving it to sit overnight. Then, it after a few hundred throws, catches, games, sweaty shakes, experiences, it gets to that sweet spot where you can slide your hand in and feel exactly where your fingertips sat last time. A good glove is for life. And this parka has lived a hundred lives.",
